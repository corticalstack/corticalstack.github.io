            My name is <strong>Jon-Paul Boyd</strong>. I am an experienced lead software developer and technical architect 
            with a successful track record providing expertise and delivering complex solutions for large enterprise. Between 
            November 2014 and December 2017 I worked as a SAP HANA technical architect for Nestle.

            I successfully completed all 8 <strong>MSc Intelligent Systems</strong> modules, all graded distinction, 
            at <strong>De Montfort University, Leicester, UK</strong>, in summer 2020. <br><br>I have a <strong>passion for A.I. 
            in health sciences</strong>, with a <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/corticalstack/corticalstack.github.io/raw/master/docs/fl/Breast Cancer Tumour Classification With FIS.pdf">paper</a> 
            classifying breast cancer tumours using fuzzy logic (outperforming neural networks and other ML approaches) 
            being submitted to the journal <em>Applied Soft Computing</em> for publication.<br><br>
            Living in a changed world with COVID-19, I want to be part of the fight, using my skills and time for something 
            good, worthy and helpful. Hence, for my <strong>Masters thesis project I'm currently working to architect, develop and 
            evaluate a COVID-19 unified research cockpit</strong>. Subfields of artificial intelligence, including natural 
            language processing (NLP) and deep learning (DL), will be leveraged to search, mine and explore COVID-19 related 
            unstructured academic literature. Features including Q&A based knowledge discovery, automated literature 
            summarization, topic classification and clustering, entity graph analysis and time series visualisation will 
            provide decision-making support to medical researchers so the best-informed next stage research actions can 
            be taken.

            At heart I am a software developer, having started coding as a teenager in the 80's and never stopped. I still 
            get a kick from building something magical that delights clients.

            <strong>My 2 children are my world</strong>, I love being a Dad, it's the most rewarding and difficult job I've ever had! 
            <strong>Kiteboarding</strong> is my passion, I feel so alive and at one with nature when skimming over the water with the 
            power of wind at my fingertips.<br><br>
            I also very much enjoy being an <strong>active driver of an eSports sim racing team</strong>, 
            taking part in endurance races including the Le Mans 24H and Spa. Being individually fast is great, however the 
            <strong>success of the team really depends on being consistent and reliable</strong>.
