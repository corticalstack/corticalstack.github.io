            My name is <strong>Jon-Paul Boyd</strong>. Between November 2014 and December 2017 I worked as a SAP HANA Technical 
            architect at Nestle. I have over 24 years of professional software and technical architecting experience, 
            providing expertise to over 36 international companies.

            I have completed all modules of <strong>MSc Intelligent Systems</strong>, with distinction, at <strong>De Montfort 
            University, Leicester, UK</strong>, in summer 2020. <br><br>Currently working on thesis around AI-based literature analysis 
            using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) of scholarly literature about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and the 
            Coronavirus group. This extensive dataset of 138,000 academic articles was compiled by the Allen Institute for 
            AI, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), Georgetown Universityâ€™s Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET), 
            Microsoft, and the National Library of Medicine (NLM). With AI analysis I look to answer such questions as 
            "<i>What is known about adaptations (mutations) of the virus?</i>" and "<i>What do we know about vaccines and 
            therapeutics?</i>".

            At heart I am a sofwtare developer, having started coding as a teenager in the 80's and never stopped. I still 
            get a kick from building something magical that delights clients.

            My 2 children are my world, I love being a Dad, it's the most rewarding and difficult job I've ever had! 
            Kiteboarding is my passion, I feel so alive and at one with nature whilst skimming over the water with the 
            power of wind at my fingertips.
