            My name is <strong>Jon-Paul Boyd. I am an experienced lead software engineer and technical architect 
            with a successful track record</strong> providing expertise and delivering complex solutions for large enterprise. Between 
            November 2014 and December 2017 I worked as a SAP HANA technical architect for Nestle. 
			
			More recently I led AC Immune's first exploration of cloud-hosted machine and deep learning technologies, developing an app to track the highly dynamic COVID-19 vaccine landscape
			and retrieve highly relevant answers to complex biomedical questions from 4.7M research paper paragraphs using state-of-the-art BERT-based search strategies.

            Graduated as <strong>Master of Intelligent Systems, with distinction</strong> from <strong>De Montfort University, Leicester, UK</strong>, in summer 2021. 
			All 8 modules and thesis project graded distinction, with an <strong>overall average grade of 90%</strong>.
            <br><br>I have a <strong>passion for A.I. 
            in health sciences</strong>, with a <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/corticalstack/corticalstack.github.io/raw/master/docs/fl/Breast Cancer Tumour Classification With FIS.pdf">paper</a> 
            classifying breast cancer tumours using fuzzy logic (outperforming neural networks and other ML approaches) 
            being submitted to the journal <em>Applied Soft Computing</em> for publication.<br><br>
            As a father living in a changed world with COVID-19, I <strong>wanted to be part of the fight</strong>, using my skills and time for something 
            good, worthy and helpful. Hence, for thesis project I chose to address 2 objectives: <strong>Support decision-making with timely & highly visual summarisation of the COVID-19 vaccine development landscape.</strong>
			<strong>Support time-pressured researchers with more effective information retrieval</strong>. I designed, developed & deployed 
			a cloud-hosted knowledge base of coronavirus research & vaccine clinical trial information for analytics and search. For much more, here's my [Master's Degree Thesis paper](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/corticalstack/corticalstack.github.io/raw/master/docs/project/Jon-Paul Boyd Masters Thesis Report COVID-LEAP state-of-the-art information retrieval.pdf) grade 90%

            At heart I am a software developer, having started coding as a teenager in the 80's and never stopped. I still 
            <strong>get a kick from building something magical that delights clients</strong>.

            <strong>My 2 children are my world</strong>, I love being a Dad, it's the most rewarding and difficult job 
            I've ever had!<br><br>
            <strong>Kiteboarding is my passion</strong>, I feel so alive and at one with nature when skimming over the water with the 
            power of wind at my fingertips.<br><br>
            I also very much enjoy being an <strong>active driver of an eSports sim racing team</strong>, 
            taking part in endurance races including the Le Mans 24H and Spa. Being individually fast is great, however the 
            <strong>success of the team really depends on being consistent and reliable</strong>.
