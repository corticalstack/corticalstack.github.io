            My name is <strong>Jon-Paul Boyd</strong>. I am an experienced lead software developer and technical architect 
            with a successful track record providing expertise and delivering complex solutions for large enterprise. Between 
            November 2014 and December 2017 I worked as a SAP HANA Technical architect for Nestle.

        <span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span>
            I have successfully completed all 8 <strong>MSc Intelligent Systems</strong> modules, all graded distinction, 
            at <strong>De Montfort University, Leicester, UK</strong>, in summer 2020. <br><br>I have a passion for A.I. 
            in health sciences, with a paper classifying breast cancer tumours using fuzzy logic (outperforming neural 
            networks and other ML approaches) being submitted to journal <em>Applied Soft Computing</em> for publication.<br><br>
            Living in a changed world with COVID-19, I want to be part of the fight, using my skills and time for something 
            good, worthy and helpful by choosing a meaningful problem domain for my Masters thesis project. Hence, I'm 
            currently working to architect, develop and evaluate an COVID-19 research cockpit in which subfields of artificial 
            intelligence, including natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning (DL), are leveraged to search, mine 
            and explore COVID-19 related unstructured academic literature. Features including Q&A based knowledge discovery, 
            automated literature summarization, topic classification and clustering, entity graph analysis and time series 
            visualisation will provide decision-making support to medical researchers so the best-informed next stage 
            research actions can be taken.

            At heart I am a software developer, having started coding as a teenager in the 80's and never stopped. I still 
            get a kick from building something magical that delights clients.

            My 2 children are my world, I love being a Dad, it's the most rewarding and difficult job I've ever had! 
            Kiteboarding is my passion, I feel so alive and at one with nature when skimming over the water with the 
            power of wind at my fingertips.
