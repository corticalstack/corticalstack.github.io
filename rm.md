### Evaluation Of A Research Paper
Evaluation of the research paper "*Immersive Collaborative Analysis of Network Connectivity: CAVE-style or Head-Mounted 
Display?*". I was drawn to this paper as I am personally a proponent of virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMD) 
as game-changing visualisation platforms, and wanted to further understand if visualisation of big data in virtual spaces 
via cost-effective hardware can deliver improved, more efficient analytical sensing and insightfulness over traditional 
2D methods.

### PhD Proposal - A Framework for Augmented Analytic Knowledge Discovery
Data volumes acquired by enterprise are increasing exponentially. Data complexity is on the rise, with growing
numbers of features and a wider variety of data types including unstructured text, images and video. It is now
extremely challenging, if not outright impossible, for humans to analyse all possible patterns and take the most
signicant, unbiased and accurate actions using manual processes. Using today's processes for business problem,
driven data analytics can take weeks or months to deliver value actions. This report proposes research to explore, 
architect, develop and evaluate a framework in which subelds of articial intelligence including machine learning (ML) 
and natural language processing (NLP) can be leveraged to augment and support the human with automated knowledge
discovery, insight understanding and decision-making support in an integrated, operationalised system.
