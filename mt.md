### COVID-LEAP (Literature Exploration Analysis Platform)
I wanted to be part of the COVID-19 fight, to use my skills and time for something good. I set two objectives for my project:

* Support Pharma/BioTech decision-making with timely and highly visual summarisation of the COVID-19 vaccine development landscape

* Support time-pressured researchers with more effective information retrieval. Identify the most relevant papers from the highly dynamic COVID-19 academic literature to answer their information needs


So, I architected and developed an Azure-cloud hosted research knowledge base for analysis & search, using high-volume COVID-19 papers (400K) & clinical trials info (500K) for evaluation. 

Vaccine trials information from multiple sources is automatically aggregated and can be explored in a highly visual way to help track and understand the dynamic vaccine development landscape.

State-of-the-art search with BERT-based strategies locates highly relevant academic papers to a biomedical question. The best strategy outperforms the "go to" PubMedCentral search engine as evaluated by a medical expert.
