### Implementation Of Movie Database Query Using Natural Language Processing & Python
Implementation of an application which transforms human natural language commands into the formal, “artificial” SQL 
language for querying of a movie database which negates the need for end-user technical database expertise. It combines 
the simplicity and flexibility of Python with the easily accessible language processing features of the open source Natural 
Language Tool Kit (NLTK) library. 

By representing a sample of movie database queries in human form with NLTK grammar rules, and matching of rule nouns and 
verbs with a WordNet corpus of synonyms, the design shows how a larger number of meanings can be derived and transformed into SQL 
code generation from a compact set of grammar rules, facilitating rapid development and simplifying rule management whilst 
improving the overall robustness, usability and success of the application.

### A Review Of State Of The Art Using Prolog For NLP
Prolog is a declarative general-purpose logic programming language first conceived in the early 1970’s by French computer 
scientist Alain Colmerauer. Its roots are in first order predicate calculus, and based on facts and rules. It has been 
widely used in artificial intelligence, especially within the interdisciplinary field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), 
providing applications with the ability to process human language due to its suitability in assembling human linguistics 
models for language search, determination and generation. 

This report presents a review of the state of the art using  Prolog with emphasis on practical application within NLP 
over the last 5 years.
