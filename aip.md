# Neural Networks For Network Attack
Neural Networks for classification of computer network activity as bad, covering intrusions and attacks, and good for 
normal connections. Data discovery first looks to understand the nature of the dataset and prepare it for optimal 
supervised machine learning. Single Layer Perceptron (SLP) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network (NN) 
architectures are modelled to make binary (good, bad) and multiclass (specific attack category) predictions. 
Each proposed model is hyperparameter tuned to extract maximum performance, then evaluated with criteria including 
detection rate, false alarm rate, accuracy, complexity of topology and training runtime cost.
