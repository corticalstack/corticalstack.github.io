# Heuristic Optimization Platform
A platform developed to generalize the optimization of both combinatorial and continuous search problems using a variety 
of well-known single and multiple particle metaheuristic methods. A hyper-heuristic feature dynamically switches between 
low-level metaheuristics to deterministically use the most appropriate according to current problem state, or select one 
stochastically. [Read more...](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/corticalstack/corticalstack.github.io/raw/master/docs/cio/Heuristic Optimization Platform.pdf)

# Testbed Problem Optimization
4 popular testbed problems are optimized with a single solution simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. [Read more...](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/corticalstack/corticalstack.github.io/raw/master/docs/cio/Testbed Problem Optimisation.pdf)
