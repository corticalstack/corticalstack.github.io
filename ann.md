# Neural Networks Detecting Intrusions And Attacks On Computer Networks
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can be defined as software or hardware systems that  automate the process of monitoring 
the events occurring in a computer system or network, analysing them for signs of security  problems. Today, they are an 
especially important component of computer network security architecture, given the increased  exposure of business 
critical process, product, financial, customer and employee internal systems and data to the internet including via 
Cloud deployment, IoT (Internet of Things), mobile self-service applications, B2B (Business to Business) and B2C 
(Business to Consumer) integration. 

With network firewalls, inbound network traffic is filtered according to a set of predefined rules, meaning malicious traffic 
can reach systems if no rules exist that match and flag such traffic. Similarly, signature based detection systems rely 
on an inventory of signature definitions to enable flagging of activity as a threat. In both cases, the technique is reactive, 
with the firewall rules and signature inventory updated only after an attack type is known. 

Conversely, IDS is both proactive and able to deal with unknown threats and abnormal activity, providing an additional 
security layer by actively classifying internal and external traffic in real time as good or bad according to characteristics 
of the network data packets, and can respond appropriately by closing ports, blacklisting I.P. addresses or sending TCP 
reset packets to break connections.

This study implements Neural Networks as the basis of an IDS that classifies computer network activity as bad, covering 
intrusions and attacks, and good for normal connections. A dataset originally prepared by MIT Lincoln labs for the 1998 
Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Intrusion Detection Evaluation Program, simulating air force base LAN 
activity, is used.

# Neural Networks For Crop Prediction And Monitoring Ecosystems
With the environment under increasing pressure from climate change and human development, there appears to be real opportunities 
to benefit from an increase in smarter farming ecosystem management given todayâ€™s perfect technology storm of available 
time-series satellite data, accessible machine learning software, elastic and affordable cloud computing, connected IoT 
and more capable UAV platforms. 

Knowing exactly when to harvest for maximum crop yield and planning for it throughout the complete supply chain brings 
significant benefit, as does knowing when to selectively apply herbicides or take action on newly identified deforestation 
or areas at risk of landslide. 

This study reviews recent application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for crop prediction, classification and monitoring 
of ecosystems. It focuses on the use of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data, which measures the difference 
between near-infrared (which vegetation strongly reflects) and red light (which vegetation absorbs), sourced from satellites 
and UAVs.
