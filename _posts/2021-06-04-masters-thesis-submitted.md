Several hundred hours and many late nights. Tears from fatigue and frustration. 

But now I'm done! 

My thesis project building a cloud-hosted framework for tracking the COVID-19 vaccine landscape and improving search over the vast collection of related academic literature is done!

So much joy from all the learnings and reward from striving to make it better. 29K words and 103 pages later, it's submitted for grading. With a Masters final grade capped at thesis grade, I now feel anxiety!
