üß™ Model merging takes multiple LLMs and combines into one. It's cost-effective (no GPU needed), and can be done on consumer hardware.

üèÜ Merging can result in SOTA models as evaluated on the Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard. My neurotic-crown-clown model just ranked 3rd (avg. 76.38) from thousands of 7B models on ü§ó. Whoop! 

üìñ Required absolutely no skill on my part, just time to read and try. As part of my learning journey, I worked through a [great blog on merging from Maxime Labonne](https://towardsdatascience.com/merge-large-language-models-with-mergekit-2118fb392b54). I really ‚ù§Ô∏è the knowledge sharing mindset of the open source LLM community, this space is really special and a great place to be.

‚ôüÔ∏è My strategy? Simple, build on the shoulders of giants with strong base models for the merge:

2. [AlphaMonarch](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/AlphaMonarch-7B) by Maxime Labonne 
3. [Jaskier-7b-dpo-v5.6](https://huggingface.co/bardsai/jaskier-7b-dpo-v5.6) from bards.ai

‚ùì As an aside, is merging merges becoming a way to game eval leaderboards?
