I've just submitted a paper titled "[Heuristic Optimization Platform For Meta And Hyper-Heuristic Solving Of Combinatorial And Continuous Problems](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/corticalstack/corticalstack.github.io/raw/master/docs/cio/Heuristic Optimization Platform.pdf)". 
As my very last piece of module work for MSc Intelligent Systems, it feels great reaching this milestone after a hard few years managing both academic and young family life.
