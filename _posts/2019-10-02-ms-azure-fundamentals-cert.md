Following AWS Cloud Practitioner certification, I jumped over to Microsoft Azure to gain some context and comparison. Core 
services for compute, storage, network and serverless appear comparable, including pricing. AWS has a huge portfolio but 
Azure also appears well rounded. So what, I was trying to understand, differentiates the 2 providers?

OK so with it's slicker design (and dark theme!) I preferred the Azure portal user experience over AWS console. More 
importantly, I can see Microsoft's strong enterprise heritage is an attraction, and with Azure active directory should 
help facilitate seemless hybrid cloud with SSO. Perhaps the geographical presence of MS offices with sales and consulting 
within easy reach wins for some?

Will it come down to the value-added, growth services around A.I. and I.o.T. that will truly differentiate? I also wondered 
whether startups naturally favour AWS? Heard first-hand from a startup their concerns in adopting Azure due to perceived 
premiums to hire/retain Azure skillsets.

Another certification as reward for the continuous learning
