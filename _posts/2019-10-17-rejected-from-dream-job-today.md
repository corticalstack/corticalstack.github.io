Today I went for an interview for my dream job as cloud solution architect at a major software vendor. Despite having a 
good, positive connection with the interviewers I didn't get it. Feels rather bad. 

I was really excited about the job and company, and felt like I had a lot of energy and passion to bring to the team. The 
2 folks doing the interviewing were really welcoming and down to earth, and showed interest in both the professional 
and academic work I've done. In fact, towards the end of the interview we were all sat close together on the same side of 
the table, browsing through some ML papers I'd written and Azure architecture I'd mapped up for a forthcoming project.
 
Unfortunately, I didnt have the "*in anger*" cloud experience they were looking for to be able to hit the ground running, 
which I understand completely. Despite it hurting, I'm determined to take this positively, knowing I had many of the elements, 
and just missing a few, which gives me goals to work on and something to aim for.
