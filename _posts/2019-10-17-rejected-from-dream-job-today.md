Today I went for an interview for my dream job as cloud solution architect. Despite a good feeling with the interviewers, 
unfortunately I didn't get it. I approached the interview with a lot of positivity and energy, with feedback as such.
Really nice welcoming people, interesting in both the professional and academic work done. It was not meant to be.
Un fortunately I didnt have the "in anger" cloud experience they were looking for to be able to hit the ground running 
with their clients, wehich is completely understandable.  Felt like I was able to speak confidently about my academic work and show my passiona for it.
I was excited about the job and esxcited about the company, and felt like I had a lot of energy and passion to bring to the team.
It feels bad, but I'm gojmng to take this positively, knowing I had many of the elementsm, but missing a few, which I can 
work on, and take action on. JUst timing is off, I have something to aim for. 

Feel like I had a good, positive connection with the interviewers.
