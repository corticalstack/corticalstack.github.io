üò¢ The livelihoods of many talented illustrators will be ruined...

ü§ñ DALL-E 3 is amazing no doubt. Excited it gives people like me, with very little artistic talent but reasonable with words access to such creativity. Absolutely. The way of progress. Yes. Sad for truly creative, artistic human beings whose jobs will become less fun and lower paid. Also yes.

üìù Prompt: "two sketches on graph paper of two robots interacting with one another. A robotic, cybernetic space cowboy with a large, long flapping duster coat and Stetson, alongside a defense artificial intelligence in the form of a black crow with piercing amber eyes and metallic wings, ink and coloured pencils, highly detailed".
