🎓 Microsoft recently released their 5-hour [Develop Generative AI solutions with Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/develop-ai-solutions-azure-openai/) learning path. I just completed, here's my thoughts on it...

👍 Your new learnings will vary based on prior knowledge. Highly recommended for beginners, it's quality content and they will learn a ton.

👍 A valuable [section on writing better prompts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/apply-prompt-engineering-azure-openai/3-write-effective-prompts), including tips on section markers which helped improve the quality of completions from a solution I'm working on.

👍 [Practical tips](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/responsible-generative-ai/3-identify-harms) on identifying, prioritizing, and testing for potentially harmful output, applicable to all LLM use cases.

👎 A section introducing working with own data within AI Studio, loading into Cognitive Search for example. Only works with public access enabled resources. Appreciate this feature is preview, but come on MS, enterprise here.

👎 DALL-E for multi-modal text to image generation is covered, but DALL-E only available in East US. The instruct variant of gpt-3.5-turbo is also discussed, but only available in certain regions. MS education is ahead of reality, where Microsoft obviously have challenges rolling these models out to meet demand.
