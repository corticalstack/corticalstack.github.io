🌟 To frame learning more on Generative AI, LLMs, and Langchain! 🌟

✨ [Currently looking at Coursera "Generative AI with Large Language Models", the content appeals!](https://lnkd.in/dtcE_8Xn)

🔗 [Also, Udemy "Develop LLM powered applications with LangChain" for more LangChain focus.](https://lnkd.in/dr2BrKm2)

❓ Any thoughts on above courses, or others you'd recommend?
