🌟 To frame learning more on Generative AI, LLMs, and Langchain! 🌟

✨ [urrently looking at Coursera [Generative AI with Large Language Models](https://lnkd.in/dtcE_8Xn), the content appeals!

🔗 Also, Udemy [Develop LLM powered applications with LangChain](https://lnkd.in/dr2BrKm2) for more LangChain focus.
