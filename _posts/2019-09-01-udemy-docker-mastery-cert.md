Weekend coming to a close but happy having just completed the excellent Udemy Docker Mastery course. Super engaging 
docker captain Bret Fisher shares a wealth of knowledge and best practice. Really high standard of teaching that will 
get you diving in, from streamlining your software development to building production grade, multi-node, fault-tolerant 
swarm clusters with the know-how to understand and manage container lifecycles. 

Excited for the week ahead, new project with docker and CI/CD pipelines here I come!
