Balancing demands of work, my ðŸ‘£ lovely family ðŸ‘£, and self-development is challenging, but happy to take another step forward this evening, having embarked on [Generative AI with Large Language Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms) from Coursera. And made good progress! ðŸŽ‰

So far mainly a refresher, having studied academically the Transformer architecture powering today's LLMs including GPT. However, Mike Chambers does an exceptional job in explaining the intuition behind the main Transformer components, so enjoyed a lot!

Looking forward to more on the Generative AI project lifecycle and LLM pre-training. Onwards! ðŸš€
