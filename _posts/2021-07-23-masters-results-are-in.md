I am very excited to share that today I have graduated as a Master of Intelligent Systems, with distinction, from De Montfort University, Leicester, UK. 

It was a really tough 3 years balancing the demands of a Masters alongside raising young twins and maintaining a marriage (!). 

The course content, academic research, and writing took me well outside my comfort zone. 

However, it was an invaluable experience, and I came out the other side almost unscathed!

Super happy with the overall results, with an average grade of 90% across all modules and thesis project. Here's an [official academic transcript of the results.]((https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/corticalstack/corticalstack.github.io/raw/master/docs/edu/DMU HEAR Jon-Paul Boyd 20210723.pdf))
