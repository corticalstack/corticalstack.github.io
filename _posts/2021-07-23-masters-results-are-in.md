I am very excited to share that today I have graduated as a Master of Intelligent Systems, with distinction, from [De Montfort University, Leicester, UK](https://www.dmu.ac.uk/home)

It was a really tough 3 years with several thousand hours of study balancing the demands of a Masters alongside raising young twins and maintaining a marriage (!)

I started it as a personal challenge to make up for a misspent youth, to prove I could stretch myself well outside my comfort zone, and gain deep knwoledge about a field of study I became very passionate about.

The journey has been an invaluable experience, I came out the other side almost unscathed! It's given me the self-confidence and skills to both build and challenge A.I. solutions, and the fuel to feed my curiosity and creativity.

I worked hard and I did it. Super happy with the overall results, with an average grade of 90% across all modules and thesis project. Here's an [official academic transcript of my results.](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/corticalstack/corticalstack.github.io/raw/master/docs/edu/DMU HEAR Jon-Paul Boyd 20210723.pdf)
