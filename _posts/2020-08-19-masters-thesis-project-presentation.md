I would not claim conciseness is a quality I have! It was however useful in further thinking through the 
approach to my thesis project on building a COVID-19 research cockpit by distilling the [ToR](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/corticalstack/corticalstack.github.io/raw/master/docs/project/tor.pdf) 
into a brief(er!) [presentation](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/corticalstack/corticalstack.github.io/raw/master/docs/project/Jon-Paul Boyd Masters Thesis Project Presentation COVID19 Research Cockpit.pdf).
