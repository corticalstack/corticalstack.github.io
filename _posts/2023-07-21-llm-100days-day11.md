🎉 What a great course by [Coursera on Generative AI with LLMs](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms#about). Completed & highly recommended!
 
👫 On my LLM journey, I walked with my old friend the Transformer, while meeting new friends along the way, including LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models) & RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback).
 
🧠 Some gaps plugged from learning more on: the GenAI lifecycle, computational calculation & challenges of training & deploying LLMs, pre-training domain specific LLMs, different fine-tuning approaches, model evaluation, aligning models with human feedback & responsible AI, integrating LLMs into applications.
 
📚 All with comprehensive notebook-based labs & links to milestone research papers.
 
🙏 Thank you Andrew Ng, Mike Chambers,Chris Fregly, Shelbee Eigenbrode, Antje Barth & the whole team who put this great course together.
