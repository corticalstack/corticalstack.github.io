Working on a Python-based platform that made available a number of different optimizers (Particle Swarm, Genetic Evolution etc) 
at solving problems, I wanted to generate a clear, good looking and informative fitness trend chart.  Spend a few hour messing 
about with Python packages [Matplotlib][matplotlib] and [Seaborn[seaborn] but wasn't satisfied with the results.

Exported the trend data out of Python in .csv format and imported into Excel. 20 seconds later I had something I was really 
happy with. A powerful reminder to focus on the end result and not on the tool. Excel, well, excels at stuff like this, and
I have so much more to learn about it.
