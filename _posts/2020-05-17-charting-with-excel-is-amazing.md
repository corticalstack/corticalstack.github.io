Just goes to show the maturity of Excel that I was able to chart fitness trend in 20 seconds with data with much nicer 
result than with using Matplotlib. Such a powerful tool. So much more efficient and time ctritical for me exporting teh data
and visualising it with Excel. It does charting great. Wanted a clear, good looking and informative fitness trend chart 
for several different optimizers and got this with Excel, focusing on thge end result and not the tool being used, not 
sticking and fiddling around with Python.

I have so much more to learn with Excel.
