We all need to rest, even when there is still so much to do, right? This weekend I took some downtime this weekend, driving 
the #Audi RS3 LMS TCR for #BoosTED #Motorsports. The sim racing community came together to support and raise awareness of 
mental health by participating in a multi-class 24 hour team race around Zolder in Belgium, raising funds for #Mind mental 
health. Organised by Jimmy Broadbent, popular Youtuber and simracer who sadly lost his father to depression. 

799 laps were turned, and we brought the car over the line 7th in class. And the best part? Charity target was £1000. Well 
exceeded, with £34457 raised for [Mind][MindUKJimmy]. I guess that about pays for a counsellor for a year. Incredible what 
happens when a community comes together.
