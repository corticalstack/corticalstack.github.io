After 3 years hard work I have all 8 Masters Intelligent Systems modules behind me, phew and wow!  So much work out of 
my comfort zone, so many late nights, but so much learned and gained. 

On now to the final piece - the project! I've decided to base it on an important problem of our times, the COVID-19 pandemic 
and the plethora of academic literature around it, which continues to grow exponentially and where much of it is poor 
quality. 

To combat this an interactive question-answering, exploration and data mining tool will be developed to enable the medical 
community to explore COVID-19 academic literature and other relevant data sources. Its purpose is to help them find the most 
relevant information they need quickly, identify patterns and gain insight from it by way of a user-friendly interface comprising 
ranked lists of search results, tagged documents, graphical visualisation of literature analytics and interactive exploration, 
all in a one-page research cockpit. 

The tool will be architected as a cloud-hosted application on the Microsoft Azure platform.
