After 3 years hard work I have all 8 Masters Intelligent Systems modules behind me, phew and wow!  So much work out of 
my comfort zone, so many late nights, but so much learned and gained. 

On now to the final piece - the project! I've decided to base it on an important problem of our times, the COVID-19 pandemic 
and the plethora of academic literature around it, which continues to grow exponentially and where much of it is poor 
quality. Hundreds of hours can easily be spent manually working through Covid papers of potential interest. 

To support medical researchers consuming and evaluating this wealth of information an interactive question-answering, 
exploration and data mining tool will be developed. Its purpose is to help them find the most relevant information they 
need quickly, and to identify patterns and emerging trends, increasing the value of their research time and enabling better 
next-step research decisions.

Elements of A.I. including natural language processing and machine learning will facilitate intelligent search and result 
aggregation, summarisation, clustering, association, classification and exploration. All this within a user-friendly, 
one-page research cockpit. 

The tool will be architected as a cloud-hosted application on the Microsoft Azure platform.
