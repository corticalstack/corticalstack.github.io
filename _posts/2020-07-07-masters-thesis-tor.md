After 3 years hard work I have all 8 Masters Intelligent Systems modules behind me, phew and wow!  So much work out of 
my comfort zone, so many late nights, but so much learned and gained. 

On now to the final piece - the project, which I've decided to base on the huge problem of our times, COVID-19. The 
plethora of academic literature on pandemic research continues to grow exponentially, much of it poor quality. To combat 
this an interactive question-answering, exploration and data mining tool will be developed to enable the medical community 
to explore COVID-19 academic literature and other relevant data sources. Its purpose is to help them find the most relevant 
information they need quickly, identify patterns and gain insight from it by way of a user-friendly interface comprising 
ranked lists of search results, tagged documents, graphical visualisation of literature analytics and interactive 
exploration, all in a one-page research cockpit. 

The tool will be architected as a cloud-hosted application on the Microsoft Azure platform.
