Covid-19 is raging across Europe. How long will it take to find a vaccine? Will a vaccine be safe for my children? Does my 
age or the age of my children make us more vulnerable? Yes, I've been consuming far too much information on the pandemic 
and need to stop! I think it's making me far more anxious and stressed than necessary. However, out of an abundance of 
caution, as a family we've decided to keep our girls at home in advance of any formal closure of the creche, as their health 
is our utmost priority. 

At least they are too young to understand what is going on and continue to enjoy a blessed life of playing, pooping and 
sleeping! I just hope my partner and I can can survive the childcare onslaught in one piece! 

Note quite sure how I'm going to manage the remainder of my Masters course work with the kids at home, there's going to be 
a lot of late late nights for sure that are going to be painful! On a positive note, I get to play with my girls more, 
they are my world so this will be awesome. Further, I'm hoping that working from home, or indeed working from anywhere, at 
flexible times, will become more widely accepted. I also hope the increased empathy for our fellow human beings continues 
after this situation calms.
