So covid, closing creche, not quite sure how going to manage remaineder of my very demanding uni course byt of course teh family comes first
Streesful for what the remainder oif the year holds. Information overload for me, consuming too much media. Wondering how long it will take to 
find a vaccine and whether it will be safe for my children. ON a positive note, hoping that working from home will become more widely accepted 
and last. NOt only working from homme, but working from anywhere, at flexible times.  I hope the increased empathy for our fellow human beings continues.
