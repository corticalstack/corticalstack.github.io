The loose ends are tied, the desk has been cleaned and the goodbyes have been said.  

So many fantastic learning opportunities 
have been thrown my way at Nestle and I've worked with a broad variety of folks so passionate about their work. I hope I 
made positive contributions. I can honestly say it's the best work experience I've had to date, both in developing my technical 
and soft skills. 

I shall miss my direct team the most, and never forget how supportive they were, especially during times 
of personal family bereavement. I hope that these relationships will endure long after life at Nestle. 

Onwards to devote some time to focus on academia.
