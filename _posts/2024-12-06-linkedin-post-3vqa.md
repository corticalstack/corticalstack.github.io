üî•Agentic AI is hot! The Y Combinator Fall batch '24 showcases this trend with startups like Sandra AI (multi-agent roles in car dealerships) and Afternoon.co (SMB accounting agents).

Regardless of underlying agentic framework, these YC startups are building to solve real world problems and adopting fundamental elements that make AI agents truly effective, including:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clear Roles
Just like humans, AI agents perform better with clear roles and contexts. Pro tip: Use role-specific keywords to nudge the LLM in the right direction and improve response quality.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Agent Focus
Less is more! Don't create a "jack of all trades" agent. Break complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks and assign dedicated agents - like building an expert team.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Strategic Tooling
Keep it minimal. Providing too many tools can impair decision-making, especially in weaker models. Equip agents with only what's essential for their specific task.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Agent Cooperation
We humans achieve better when brainstorming together, right? Same with AI agents, they excel when collaborating. Using shared long and short term memory, and inter-agent messaging, they can delegate tasks, share feedback, learn collectively, and build on shared insights.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Agent Guard Railing
Prevent your agents from derailing. Guardrails are your safety net. They help prevent hallucinations and ensure consistent, reliable results. 

What elements would you add?
