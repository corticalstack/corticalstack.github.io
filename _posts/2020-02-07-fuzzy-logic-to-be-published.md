Result has just been awarded for my work on developing a fuzzy logic inference system (FIS) for breast cancer tumour classifiction.
Absolutely delighted that my Professors deem it worth of journal publication, I feel emotional right now given that I poured 
so much into trying to understand fuzzy logic, reading lecture slides/notes and Klir's book over and over until it clicked 
through brute force! Many head-battering days and late nights.  Will be working to refine the paper further for publication 
in Applied Soft Computing.
