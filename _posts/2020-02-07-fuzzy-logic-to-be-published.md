Today I received my result for my Uni fuzzy logic practical assignment. I chose to developing a fuzzy logic inference system 
(FIS) for breast cancer tumour classification. 

It was graded 98%. I feel emotional right now about that, given I poured so much into trying to understand the topic, 
reading lecture notes and Klir's "*Fuzzy Set Theory*" book over and over until it clicked through brute force! Many 
head-battering days and late nights went into this. I'm absolutely delighted that my Professors deem it worth of journal 
publication, and the plan is to refine the [paper](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/corticalstack/corticalstack.github.io/raw/master/docs/fl/Breast Cancer Tumour Classification With Fuzzy Information System.pdf) 
further further for publication in [Applied Soft Computing](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/applied-soft-computing).
