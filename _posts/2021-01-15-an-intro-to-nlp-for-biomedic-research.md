With the last few years deep diving machine and deep learning, it was a challenge rising to the surface to prepare and present NLP that is concise and sparks thoughts on how it might help a non-technical audience with their domain challenges.

With some questions from the audience and follow-up discussions, I hope I got the message across. Anyway, here's the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/corticalstack/corticalstack.github.io/raw/master/docs/nlp/An introduction to NLP.pdf)
