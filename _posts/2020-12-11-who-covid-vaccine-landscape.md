Today I discovered the World Health Organisation (WHO) publish detailed information on [COVID-19 vaccine candidates](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines), including developer, vaccine platform, and clinical trial phase.

This could be a really useful source for insight into the vaccine development landscape that might include:

* understanding which vaccines are moving closer to an authorised market product
* how quickly vaccines are moving through clinical trials
* which vaccine platforms (e.g., RNA, DNA) are dominating research
* who is making the largest research investments


If only it was published as an easily machine readable .json format. Currently in .pdf, there's some wrangling to be done! It does beg the question though - with such a highly evolving pandemic, organisations such as the WHO really need to understand their audience better and when releasing publications like this, make consumption easier and more robust - release in .json please!
