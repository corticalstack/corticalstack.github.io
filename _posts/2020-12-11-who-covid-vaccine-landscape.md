Today I discovered the World Health Organisation (WHO) publish detailed information on COVID-19 vaccine candidates, including developer, vaccine platform, and clinical trial phase.

This could be a really useful source for insight into the vaccine development landscape that might include:

* understanding which vaccines are moving closer to an authorised market product
* how quickly vaccines are moving through clinical trials
* which vaccine platforms (e.g., RNA, DNA) are dominating research
* who is making the largest research investments


If only it was published as an easily machine readable .json format. Currently in .pdf, there's some wrangling to be done!
