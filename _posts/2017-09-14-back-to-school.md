Today my application to enrol as a distance learning student on [MSc Intelligent Systems][mscis] at [De Montfort University, Leicester, UK][dmu] 
has been accepted. So so happy about this! Although I've always been a continual learner, it's been several decades since last
in a more formal academic setting, and at that time never achieved both what I and my family had hoped for. Now is the chance 
to fix that, I'm super motivated!

It's going to take a huge amount of effort to read extensively on a specific topic and soak up all that information, then 
translate the learning into technical implementations with supporting academic papers several pages long.  And the maths bits, uggh, 
that's really out of my comfort zone. I'm hoping that years of consulting will help me get organised and  prioritize work 
to deadlines. Most importantly, I have the support of my partner which will help balanace the demands of work, personal 
and academic life.
