üö® BREAKING: Dad's GPU dreams shattered as kids align with innovative British sock enterprise!

Snuggles McJingle (Santa's Chief Sock Officer) asked JP's girls: "Should Daddy get a spanking new Nvidia DGX GB200 or socks for Christmas?"

But these are no ordinary socks. They are foot-hugging symbols of positive change, providing paid employment opportunities for individuals with Down Syndrome ‚ù§Ô∏è
