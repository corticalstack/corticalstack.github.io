Having completed several online courses recently, it was so pleasurable going back to hardcopy and work through [Fran√ßois 
Chollet's][francois] book [Deep Learning With Python][dlwp] and published by Manning (which, imo do the best range of 
technical books). Written by the creator of the Keras deep learning library, every page was a light-bulb moment, explaining 
the theory and practice of neural networks so clearly (without needing to be a mathematician!) that every page was a joy 
to read. 

Regardless of any deep learning framework you are thinking of getting into (Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch, H2O etc), this is 
a great place to start.
