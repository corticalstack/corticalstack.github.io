Sat and passed the AWS foundation certification, yeah!

Thinking ahead to my Masters project, I set out on a journey to ramp up some cloud skills, starting with the biggest 
provider of them all, AWS.  I wanted to better understand their huge service portfolio, so when the times comes to architect 
and build cloud solutions I could make well-informed decisions. I'm super happy to share the outcome of this prep is AWS 
Cloud Practitioner certification.

Beyond "standard" stuff like auto-scaling & load balancing compute resources, some other services really stood out for me. 
AWS Lambda for FaaS (Functions as a Service) serverless, stateless compute. AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure as code, 
for reliable, repeatable and self-documenting resource provisioning. AWS API Gateway to publish and log API calls. AWS SQS 
allowing those decoupled microservices to communicate with each other.

All the learning resources (online course, whitepapers) studied for the certification exam are free, here you go!
