Following last week's post about [WHO publishing COVID-19 vaccine information](https://corticalstack.ai/2020-12-11-who-covid-vaccine-landscape/), it seems someone at the WHO has a sense of humour! 

After 29 publications in .PDF format, yesterdayâ€™s publication is now in .CSV. Yes it's far easier to digest with machine, and at least I've proven how to extract data from .pdf tables.

But....json please, and be consistent, for the sake of all engineers maintaining scripts to ingest this valuable information.
